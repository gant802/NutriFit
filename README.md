# Welcome to NutriFit!

## The app that allows you to find workouts, schedule them on your calendar, search nutritional value of foods and post about your fitness journey.

This project was created solely by myself (Grant Cummings) for the purpose of having an app with an all in one fitness journey feel. It has the social aspect, workout aspect and the usually unseen part of trying to eat healthy.
